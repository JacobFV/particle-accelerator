## Background

A quick Google query of "fusor" yields dozens of do-it-yourself articles on how to construct an endothermic dueterium fusion reactor. The website https://fusor.net/ provided much essential information. I extracted the following information from the articles listed below:  

- https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Build-a-Fusion-Reactor-and-Become-Part-of-t/
- https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-A-Fusion-Reactor/
  - 40 kV 10mA supply (negative polarity) from 
  - 75 millitorr primary vacuam pump in addition to a secondary oil diffusion or turbopump
  - lead shielded camera viewport
  - 
- https://www.instructables.com/id/Real-Life-Arc-Reactor-a-Working-Fusion-Reactor-Mod/
  - used a ZVS driver with flyback transformer
  - single vacuam pump
- https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/how-to-build-a-usd1000-fusion-reactor-in-your-basement
  - 20kV 10mA
  - "A two-stage roughing pump \[...\] Then use a turbo or oil diffusion pump to reach a high vacuum"
  
All the tutorials stressed the importance of maintaining high chamber vacuam by avoiding fingerprints or other contaminants. For this reason, vacuam pumps do not appear a best choice for second stage chamber evacuation.

Most projects employed ordinary glass jars to construct the chamber walls

## Theory

## Design

In addition to energy imparted from electrostatic acceleration, I will eploy a magnetic pinch towards the center of the accelerator to both increase particulate density and radially confine the collided particles logner. I hope this magnetic field will maintain a higher reaction reaction profile for longer time which may increase internal energy gain.
